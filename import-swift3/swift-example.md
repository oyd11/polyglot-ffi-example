Currently:
 * Links statically with Dynamic Library (no dynamic loading)
 * Copies shared library to current dir, to simplify loadpath's etc
 * Didn't get interpreted version `swift` commandline to running (missing the dynamic-library) (only compiled `swiftc` version)

Excuse the .exe extension standard, it simplifies .gitignore .dockerignore

run:
 * make 
 * ./test.exe
